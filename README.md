# weblogic-configuration-script

weblogic-configuration-script is a [Python](http://www.python.org/) set of scripts that abstract creation, management and monitor of Weblogic Server domains. It uses de [WLST - WebLogic Scripting Tool](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15051_01/wls/docs103/config_scripting/using_WLST.html) under the roof, creating an abstraction layer and a two-ways interface to easily integrate with tools like [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) into automatic proccesses.
